# How to use
1. Import the project
2. Launch the scene "HiveFive"
3. The scene has no cameras, so switch back to the scene view
4. If the swarms are not visible, double click on "BiologicalSwarm" or "NonBiologicalSwarm"
5. Use the two SwarmManagers to change parameters
6. To move the swarms you have to change the positions of the SwarmManagers

# Data for the biological swarm
For our biological swarm, we use an excerpt of Ob4.txt from the following data source: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201936#Sec7

The data was published as part of the following publication: Sinhuber, M. _et al._ The Subnational Human Development Database. _Sci. Data_. 6:190036 https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2019.36 (2019).

To use other data, the text file "BiologicalSwarmTimeSeries.txt" in the root directory must be modified accordingly.
